# Neural-Network
A neural network is structured like the human brain and consists of artificial neurons, also known as nodes. These nodes are stacked next to each other in three layers:
1. The input layer 
2. The hidden layer(s)
3. The output layer
4. Activation function and the optimizer 

Types of Neural networks are CNN, RNN, 
 1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks specifically designed for tasks involving structured grid-like data, such as images and sequences.
 2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network architecture designed to handle sequential data by introducing the concept of recurrent connections. RNNs have a unique ability to maintain a form of memory, allowing them to process sequences of inputs while considering the order and temporal dependencies of the data.
